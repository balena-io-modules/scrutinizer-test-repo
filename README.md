scrutinizer-test-repo
===========

This repository serves as a playground for [Scrutinizer](https://github.com/balena-io-modules/scrutinizer).

Scrutinizer's test suite relies on various metadata including 'Integrations' and more. These properties can change at any time in an active project. Consequently, this repository will serve as a predictable point of reference for our tests.
